--  Request a lock with the given mode. Note that this routine is
--    overloaded based on the type of its first argument.  The
--    appropriate routine is used based on how it is called.
--    If a deadlock is detected, then an arbitrary session is
--    chosen to receive deadlock status.
--    ***NOTE*** When running both multi-threaded server (dispatcher) AND
--    parallel server, a multi-threaded "shared server" will be
--    bound to a session during the time that any locks are held.
--    Therefore the "shared server" will not be shareable during this time.
--  Input parameters:
--    id
--      From 0 to 1073741823.  All sessions that use the same number will
--      be referring to the same lock. Lockids from 2000000000 to
--      2147483647 are accepted by this routine.  Do not use these as
--      they are reserved for products supplied by Oracle Corporation.
